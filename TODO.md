## TODO's

- [x] make loading screen / splash screen

### App Ideas Using api

1. **Pokédex App**

- [] Search Pokémon by name or ID
- [] Show sprite, type, stats (HP, Attack, etc.)
- [] Add “favorite Pokémon” feature (stored locally with AsyncStorage)

2. **Pokémon Battle Simulator (Light Version)**

- [] Choose two Pokémon → display stats side-by-side
- [] Simple “battle” logic based on attack/defense totals

3. **Pokémon Type Explorer**

- [] Filter Pokémon by type (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.)
- [] Color-coded cards with type icons

4. **Guess the Pokémon Game**

- [] Show a silhouette (sprite with brightness reduced)
- [] User guesses the name
- [] Reveal with animation (easy to do in Expo with `react-native-reanimated` or `moti`)

5. **Pokémon Quiz App**

- [] “Which Pokémon has the higher base HP?”
- [] “Which type is super effective against Fire?”
- [] Randomized questions from the API
