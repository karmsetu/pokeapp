## TODO's

- [x] make loading screen / splash screen

### App Ideas Using api

1. **Pokédex App**

- [x] Search Pokémon by name or ID
- [x] Show sprite, type, stats (HP, Attack, etc.)
- [] Add “favorite Pokémon” feature

2. **Pokémon Battle Simulator (Light Version)**

- [] Choose two Pokémon → display stats side-by-side
- [] Simple “battle” logic based on attack/defense totals

3. **Pokémon Type Explorer**

- [] Filter Pokémon by type (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.)
- [] Color-coded cards with type icons

4. **Guess the Pokémon Game**

- [x] start button
- [x] streak
- [x] get random pokemon
- [x] Show a silhouette (sprite with brightness reduced)
- [x] User guesses the name
- [x] Reveal with animation (easy to do in Expo with `react-native-reanimated` or `moti`)

5. **Pokémon Quiz App**

- [x] “Which Pokémon has the higher base HP?”
- [x] “Which type is super effective against Fire?”
- [x] Randomized questions from the API
